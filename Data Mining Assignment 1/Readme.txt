Explored various things such as : Sorting an array, finding min and max element of an array, find number of days between 2 dates, plotting a basic graph using matplotlib.
Also developing a webpage for a restaurant using HTML and Flask Server. The webpage has a home, about and menu page.

For question 2 - Assignment_q2 : Contains the google colab python notebook to explore various python concepts. 
Explored various concepts started from print statements to arithmetic operations, if statements, for and while loops, data structures such as lists, tuples and dictionaries, functions, Classes and objects. 

For question 3 - Assignment_q3 : Contains the document which has the Youtube link to the video - exploring jadbio and creating an ML Project to predict Iris species. The document also has steps and screenshots of the second ML project - predicting cardio vascular diseases based on various patient information. The datasets for Iris plant species prediction and Patient medical records were obtained from Kaggle as CSV files.

The first project uses Jadbio for predicting an Iris species data - with data such as sepal length, width and petal length and width and species of Iris. It classifies Iris into 3 species - Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica. A test data set is then given to test the ml model where the model predicts the Iris species for the test data set. Various factors such as key feature elements and Accuracy are observed from the Jadbio tool. 

The second project uses Jadbio for predicting presence or absence of cardiovascular disease in a patient based on various information about the patient such as age, weigh, height, Blood pressure, smoking, drinking, cholestrol, glucose and physical activity. Here presence or absence of cardio vascular disease is a binary value. A test data set is given to test the ml model where the model predicts the presence of absence of cardiovascular disease in a patient. Various features such as key fetaure elements and confusion matrix are observed from the Jadbio tool.
